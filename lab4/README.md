1  The Eight Queens Problem
Write a recursive method which solves the eight queens problem.  You must find
a state where you can place eight queens on a chessboard such that no queen
can capture another queen.  Queens can move and capture pieces in the same
row, column, or any diagonal.
You may use an 8

8
int[][]
array to represent your chess board.


2  Towers of Hanoi
Write  a  recursive  method  that  prints  out  the  individual  moves  you  need  to
perform to solve a Towers of Hanoi problem with
n
rings.
In Towers of Hanoi, you have three pegs and
n
disks, each a different size.

The game starts with all the disks places on the left in sorted order, with the
largest disk on the bottom,  and the smallest on the top.  The objective is to
move all the disks from the leftmost peg to the rightmost peg, with the following
rules in place.


1.  You can only move one disk at a time.
2.  A move moves the top disk on one peg and places it on top of another
peg.
3.  You may not put a larger disk on top of a smaller disk

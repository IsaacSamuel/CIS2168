#Circular Linked List

Soldiers form a circle and count around the circle some predetermined number.
When this number is reached, that person receives a lot and leaves the circle.
The count starts over with the next person.
Build a Circular Linked List with the provided code to represent the circle of
people and simulate the problem.  Your program should use two parameters,
n and k, where n is the number of people and k is the number of counts. 
In other words, we successively remove the kth person from the list.



Here are examples of rings with n people and every kth person is removed from
the ring. For a ring of n = 5 and the count k= 2:
1
1 ==> 2 ==> 3 ==> 4 ==> 5 ==>
1 ==> 3 ==> 4 ==> 5 ==>
1 ==> 3 ==> 5 ==>
3 ==> 5 ==>
3

#Labs and homework for Data Structures and Algorithms, CIS 2168

These are the labs and homeworks for CIS 2168 at Temple University. (Taken in Spring 2017 with Dr. Andrew Rosen, the coolest professor ever.)

These are posted on github primarily for my own convenience. If you are in the class, please feel free to use them as a reference if you are stuck, but please don't download them to submit them as your own. I promise that you will fail the exams if you do that. Also, you'll be super lame.
